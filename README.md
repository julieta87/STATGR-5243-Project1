Project 1 
1. Dataset: NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Data https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page
2. Once you download the years and months you want to look at, you have to convert it (from PARQUET to csv). You can either use an online converter, or use code provided here to run.
3. The code provided here is downloadable, and as long as you have the files downloaded, you can run the code on the files. *Note*: it does take a while for the data to run since it is very large (15 minutes average)   

We each played around and explored a given year, so there are multiple .py and .ipynb files presented here with data cleaning preprocessing, and other tasks.

Note: There are individual years such as 2024 uploaded here to get familiar with the data structure, practice merging the months, and data processing.
